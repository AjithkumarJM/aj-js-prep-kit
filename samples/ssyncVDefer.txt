Async V Defer

Normal script tag behavior:
In general, the browser parses HTML first, if it sees a script tag it will pause the HTML parsing, then fetch the script, load the script continue the parsing

<script src=".." />

Async behavior:
The browser parses HTML, and scripts are fetched asynchronously, In between if the script is fetched, the parsing will stop, it will load the script and then continue parsing HTML

<script async src=".." />

Defer behavior:

The browser parses HTML, scripts are fetched asynchronously, but in this case the script will load only when the parsing of HTML is done

<script defer src=".." />
